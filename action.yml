    description: >
      Root directory containing build definition sources (build.sbt, build.sc, etc.)
      If the sbt or mill build definition files are in a sub-directory, pass the path to this
      sub-directory here.

      Override for the path of the coursier cache.
      By default, the coursier cache is assumed to be in the default OS-dependent location.
      Set this input to override that. Note that this action will also set COURSIER_CACHE
      if an override is specified, so that you don't have to set it yourself.
    default: ''
  job:
    required: false
    description: >
      Job name, to be used in the cache key, so that each job has its own cache.
    default: '${{ github.job }}'
  matrix:
    required: false
    description: >
      Matrix values, when using the matrix strategy.
      When using build matrices for more than the OS (for Scala versions, JDKs, test suites, …),
      pass the matrix values here, with `matrix: -dollar-{{ toJson(matrix) }}`. The matrix instance is hashed,
      and added to the cache key, so that each matrix instance has its own cache, and those caches don't
      collide.
    default: '${{ toJson(matrix) }}'
  extraFiles:
    required: false
    description: >
      Extra files to take into account in the cache key.
      By default, sbt build definition files (*.sbt, project/**.{scala,sbt}, project/build.properties) and
      mill build definition files (*.sc, ./mill) are hashed to uniquely identify the cached data. Upon
      cache restoration, if an exact match is found, the cache is not saved again at the end of the job.
      In case of no exact match, it is assumed new files may have been fetched; the previous cache for the
      current OS, if any, is restored, but a new cache is persisted with a new key at the end of the job.
      To take into account extra files in the cache key, pass via extraFiles either
      - a single path as a string
      - multiple paths in a JSON array, encoded in a string
      Blobs are accepted (processed by [glob-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-all)).
